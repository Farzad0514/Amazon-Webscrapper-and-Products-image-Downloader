Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer. This travel mug keeps beverages hot for 5 hours or cold for 9, making it a great choice for long days out and about or in the office. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce travel mug is virtually durable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The contoured body shape is easy to grip and fits most automobile cup holders and is single serve compatible. For tea drinkers, a built-in tea hook is just the ticket to brew tea on the go. The tea hook can also accommodate most loose leaf infusers. The Stainless King Travel Mug comes equipped with a 100% leak-proof Drink Lock sealing lid which operates simply by pushing the lever 45 degrees right or left to open and close. And because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the travel mug just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the mug with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. The Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Travel Mug is made of BPA-free materials and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.'",['Only 4 left in stock.'],Amazon AU,Amazon AU,$41.97,https://www.amazon.com.au/Thermos-Stainless-Ounce-Travel-Handle/dp/B00ETP7DAW/ref=sr_1_103?dchild=1&m=ANEGB3WVEVKZB&qid=1601494762&refinements=p_36%3A3900-5000%2Cp_n_free_shipping_eligible%3A5363790051%2Cp_72%3A2547912051%2Cp_6%3AANEGB3WVEVKZB&rnid=5355409051&s=kitchen&sr=1-103

Now lodge has added a new line of seasoned steel skillets. This handy 8-inch seasoned steel skillet is the only pre-seasoned and ready to use out of the box steel pan in the market place right now. Each skillet is pre-seasoned with natural soy bean oil. Maintains very low and very high temperatures, making the pan a highly effective and versatile cooking piece. It performs well in residential and professional kitchens as well as outdoors. Made of 12 gauge carbon steel. Steel is a high density metal that does not retain odors. If maintained correctly, it will last a lifetime. Thickness of the cooking surface allows the pan to heat up quickly but also retain the heat needed for even cooking. The handle angle is conducive for both stove top and oven cooking. Each handle is attached to the skillet with 3 secure rivets. The black patina given to the cookware by the factory seasoning process is, in fact, vegetable oil that has been baked into a piece of cookware that has emerged from an individual sand mold. This coating of oil is a functional application and not a cosmetic application. The cookware is hanging as it rides through the electrostatic sprayer and commercial conveyer ovens at very high temperatures. This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the carbon steel which creates an easy release finish. As a result of this process, you may see a blister or bubble of oil at the southern-most point or at the end of the handle of the cookware piece. If visible, it will rub or flake off with your finger, leaving a brown spot. Don’t worry, it’s not rust but a seasoned spot that is brown, indicative of the varnish stage of seasoning. The brown spot will turn black with use.
